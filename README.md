# SimOS

SimOS comprises of a driver shell script which executes the
C++ executable files to simulate various OS concepts like CPU
Scheduling, System Calls, Deadlock Avoidance Algorithms, etc.

Currently SimOS is compatible for running on Arch Linux Distributions.
At present efforts are being made to containerize the package
using Dockers to make it platform independent.
